                        <p>The time when justice was honoured and betrayal were a sin. The time when there lived Lord Zeus, the king of Justice. Lord Zeus was the last child of Cronus and Rhea and he maintained to keep his brilliant and honoured position on the most magnanimous and pacifying summit of Mount Olympus and was looked upon by all Gods and Mortals. The Lords bragged of being a descendant of Lord Zeus and tried to do justice with their respective positions. The tossing of the rain to the shining sun was all controlled by Zeus, he moulded the climate according to his temper. A pure resemblance of an afternoon turned all dusky and cloudy was an angry and fierce Zeus while a blooming and shining day would demonstrate a happy and gay Lord. When in high spirits the Lord would favour the world with a fine climate, a terrible temperament would accompany thunderbolts and lightings.</p><p>The day of justice was all taken care by Zeus, he was the king of Justice, the breaker of the chains. He was termed as the “Master of Justice”, rebuffing anyone who lied or assaulted the public, yet he was much reasonable and continually endeavouring to maintain a balance in the society. But today, the real day Zeus is lost and concealed into the bribery of the world, the society now needs such enigmatic and valiant lords to overpower the treacheries and pain against the suppressed, who demand a justice. Justice delayed is justice denied. Zeus wedded his own sister Hera, the goddess of marriage and monogamy, yet was giving her a lot of reasons to be envious, since Zeus was famous for his various relationships, therefore Lord Zeus had many children. He was entitled as the God of the Sky, light and thunder and was duly respected for being the Lord of Law, Order and Justice. The Lord was keenly engaged in his works to free people from the strangled chain of slavery and gave them the liberty to choose their profession. The world was a better place to live in with fewer atrocities and sufferings with no dominance of the Rich on the poor, the Lord kept liberalism as the key to a happy life in the world. According to him, the wrong should never be given a second chance for his deeds and hence he punished with vigour and pleased the people who deserved justice. These decisions of the Lord kept a decent amount of décor and peace in the world, although even Lord Zeus was a step below when it came to the working of Karma and Fate. Karma was always way ahead in punishing and rewarding people and yet fate played its role. The world today needs more Lords like Zeus to maintain the equilibrium of the good over the evil.
